## Final Recommendation

Rupert Furniture should double down on logistics that support faster delivery, particularly for urban and suburban zones where quick service converts more customers. The sales data highlights a need to continue investing in online channels while maintaining a robust retail presence for traditional shoppers. Product design and marketing teams should focus on expanding high-performing categories like tables and sofas, and create targeted campaigns based on regional material preferences (e.g., wood in suburban, fabric in urban). Leveraging popular material-color combinations, as well as Brand Câ€™s momentum, can give Rupert a sharper edge in the competitive furniture market.
